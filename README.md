# Exploring business data using MySQL & Tableau

In this project I use SQL to explore the database of Magist(made-up). Magist is a Service company that offers a centralised order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces. You can see the Schema of the Database [here](https://github.com/Khangt213/DataExploring/blob/main/Schema.pdf)
